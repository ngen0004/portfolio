   - a navigation section in the header with my logo

   - and a footer section with copyright and icons to my social media accounts

The second page is about me (about.html):
   - a navigation section in the header with my logo
   - my profile picture and a paragraph of how I feel about my passion
   - a link to my resume file
   - a footer section

The third page is services (services.html):

   - different services that I offer to people
